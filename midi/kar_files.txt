Q: What is the MIDI Karaoke Type 1 (.KAR) file format?

A: A MIDI Karaoke file is a Standard MIDI File type 1 that contains a separate track with lyrics of the song entered as text events. Load one of the MIDI karaoke files into a sequencer to examine the contents of the tracks of the file. The first track contains text events that are used to make the file recognizable as the MIDI Karaoke file. @KMIDI KARAOKE FILE text event is used to for that purpose. The optional text event @V0100 denotes the format version number. Anything starting with @I is any information you want to include in the file.

The second track contains the text meta events for the lyrics of the song. The first event is @LENGL. It identifies the language of the song, in this case English. The next couple of events start with @T which identifies the title of the songs. You can have up to three events like these. The first event should contain the title of the song. Some programs (ex. Soft Karaoke) read this event to get the name of the song to be displayed in the File Open dialog box. The second event usually contains the performer or author of the song. The third event can contain any copyright information or anything else.

The rest of the second track contains the words of the song. Each event is the syllable that is supposed to be sung at the time of the event. If the text starts with \, it means to clear the screen and show the words at the top of the screen. If the text starts with /, it means to go to the next line.

'time' is ticks since last event
